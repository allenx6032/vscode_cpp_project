      *      Barriers created with 'attr' can be shared between
      *      processes if pthread_barrier_t variable is allocated
      *      in memory shared by these processes.
      *
      * PARAMETERS
      *      attr
      *              pointer to an instance of pthread_barrierattr_t
      *
      *      pshared
      *              must be one of:
      *
      *                      PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED
      *                              May be shared if in shared memory
      *
      *                      PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE
      *                              Cannot be shared.
      *
      * DESCRIPTION
      *      Mutexes creatd with 'attr' can be shared between
      *      processes if pthread_barrier_t variable is allocated
      *      in memory shared by these processes.
      *
      *      NOTES:
      *              1)      pshared barriers MUST be allocated in shared
      *                      memory.
      *
      *              2)      The following macro is defined if shared barriers
      *                      are supported:
      *                              _POSIX_THREAD_PROCESS_SHARED
      *
      * RESULTS
      *              0               successfully set attribute,
      *              EINVAL          'attr' or pshared is invalid,
      *              ENOSYS          PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED not supported,
      *
